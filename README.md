#This tool fundamentally exploits a vulnerability in the Windows OS, sending malware to modders' email addresses via GTA5#



*Where does this tool get its email address from? **

**You need a Rockstar account to play GTA5**

**When you enter a GTA5 session, your personal information is sent to the Rockstar server for verification**.

**GTA5 is a P2P server, basically we hackers can easily steal and sell the personal information of script kiddies**.







Step 1 Open GTA5
Step 2 Enter online session
Step 3 Activate the tool
Step 4 Wait until the tool builds a database of players from the session
(30 seconds)
Step 5 Once the tool identifies the modder's email address, it will send the auto-executing malware embedded in the image to that email address.
